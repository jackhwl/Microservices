# Magic common

This is where the Magic literally occurs. These projects functions as base classes and other helpers for your own
projects, which is the reason why we can create _"Super DRY Magic"_ using Magic. See the _"magic.todo"_ projects
for examples of how to use these projects and classes in your own projects.
